                Boi Poka is a modern book store web application built using React, designed to deliver a fast, interactive, and user-friendly reading experience. The primary goal of this project is to showcase modern frontend development practices while creating a functional and visually appealing bookstore platform.

                Users can explore a curated collection of books, view detailed information, and manage their personal reading lists with ease. The application is structured using a component-based architecture, with efficient state management and dynamic routing to ensure smooth navigation and scalability across the app.

                This project was developed as part of my React learning journey, with a strong focus on clean code, reusable components, and responsive design. It reflects my passion for building real-world web applications that balance performance, usability, and simplicity.
